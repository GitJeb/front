## Overview & Planning

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
As a team, we work closely with each other to brainstorm and work on features. We break down the day's work by doing SCRUM every morning and
ending the day with a retro meeting. We started with the backend setting up the api. Then we use scripts to test if each CRUD action is working.
Once that was completed we worked on the front actions and connecting the actions together with the api. Lastly we worked on styling the site and making sure we meet MVP requirements.
